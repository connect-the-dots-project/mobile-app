# The Connect the Dots Project

Connect the Dots is a [Samsung Solve for Tomorrow](https://www.samsung.com/us/solvefortomorrow/) project designed to help people 
struggling or on the verge of homelessness to get the resources they need such as bus routes, soup kitchens, and clothing in real 
time through the mobile app or a kisok.
